# Paren6
### Ben McGunigle <bnmcgn@gmail.com>

Paren6 is a set of ES6 macros for Parenscript.

Many modern Javascript examples are given in ES6 code. While almost 
everything that ES6 does can be replicated in standard ES5, it often takes 
considerable boilerplate to get it done. This library is designed to ease 
the task of transcribing ES6 code into Parenscript, either by providing 
ES6-like macros or by documenting existing features of Parenscript that 
fill the desired function.

Paren6, like Parenscript, outputs ES5 compatible code.
